# 🔗 Introduction to LangChain - Python

## Introduction

Welcome to LangChain Academy's Introduction to LangChain course!

---

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites

- The Chrome browser is recommended
- Ensure you're using Python >=3.12, <3.14 [More info](#python-virtual-environments)
- A package/project manager: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
    - note: `uv` is also required in Module 2, Lesson 1 to run the MCP server with `uvx`


### Installation

Download the course repository
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/lca-lc-foundations.git
cd lca-lc-foundations
```

Make a copy of example.env
```bash
# Create .env file
cp example.env .env
```

Edit the .env file to include the keys below. [More info](#model-providers)
```bash
# Required for model usage
OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
TAVILY_API_KEY='your_tavily_api_key_here'

# optional, only used in Lesson 1 once
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your_anthropic_api_key_here'
GOOGLE_API_KEY='your_google_api_key_here'

# Optional for evaluation and tracing
LANGSMITH_API_KEY='your_langsmith_api_key_here'
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=lca-lc-foundation
# Uncomment the following if you are on the EU instance:
#LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com
```

Make a virtual environment and install dependencies. [More info](#python-virtual-environments)

### Python Virtual Environments 

Managing your Python version is often best done with virtual environments. This allows you to select a Python version for the course independent of the system Python version.

<details open>
<summary>Using uv (recommended)</summary>

`uv` will install a version of Python compatible with the versions specified in the `pyproject.toml` in the `.venv` directory when running the `uv sync` specified above. It will use this version when invoking with `uv run`. For additional information, please see [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Using pyenv + pip</summary>

If you are using pip instead of uv, you may prefer using pyenv to manage your Python versions. For additional information, please see [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

```bash
pyenv install 3.12
pyenv local 3.12
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

</details>

### Model Providers

If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can sign up [here](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/). The course primarily uses gpt-5-nano which is very inexpensive.
You may also obtain additional API keys for [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) or [Google](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/google). These models are only used in the first lesson.

This course has been created using particular models and model providers.  You can use other providers, but you will need to update the API keys in the .env file and make some necessary code changes. LangChain supports many chat model providers [here](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/all_providers).

Tavily is a search provider that returns search results in an LLM-friendly way. They have a generous free tier. [Tavily](https://tavily.com)

### Getting Started with LangSmith

- Create a [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) account
- Create a LangSmith API key

- Update your .env file you created with your new LangSmith API Key.

For more information on LangSmith, see our docs [here](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/home).

### Environment Variables

This course uses the [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv) module to read key-value pairs from the .env file and set them in the environment in the Jupyter notebook. They do not need to be set globally in your system environment.

### Development Environment

The course uses [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. Jupyter is installed and can be run as described above. Jupyter notebooks can also be edited and run in VSCode or other VSCode variants such as Windsurf or Cursor. 


### Ollama Option

To save cost and still be able to practice these codes, Ollama was installed.

For linux
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

Recommended models
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b # For general work
ollama pull mistral:7b # Very fast
ollama pull rockn/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B-Q4_K_M # For vision and voice 
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large # For embedding
```
